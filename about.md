<p>
  Since when I graduated from <a href="http://www.ucs.br/">UCS</a> (a "small" university on Brazil), I'm not sure about what I should keep reading and studying. Then I re-create a blog (this time using Jekyll) to put some experiments and notes. I hope this can be useful to you too.
</p>
<p>
  My old blog still available (in Portuguese): <a href="http://ratosdelaboratorio.blogspot.com.br/">http://ratosdelaboratorio.blogspot.com.br/</a>
</p>
<p>
  And, of course, I hope this help me to get better writing in English...
