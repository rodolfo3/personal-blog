  <h1>Hi!</h1>

  <p>
    This is my personal blog and I created it to take notes and share random projects. There is no warranties about the content, neither about frequent posts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another reason is make public my projects. I'm testing the <a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/11/12/got-a-serious-goal-make-it-public/">Got a Serious Goal? Make it Public.</a> approach. I usually starts a lot of projects, but don't document the process, forget how I can do things and don't finish them. Let's do different this time...
